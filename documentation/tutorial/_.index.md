# Kickstart library tutorial

Kickstart is intended to ease the way for beginners in C++, and helps to shorten example code for those who help others on the net.

## 1. Installation & compiler requirements.

All you need to do is download, copy and rename, so that the compiler finds the `<kickstart/`&hellip;`>` headers. There is no need to compile the library on its own. All the library code is in headers that you just `#include`.

Installation is described in more detail in [a separate document](../../source/examples/hello-world.md).

Then after installation, to use Kickstart you need to use a compiler option that specifies at least ***C++17***. Also, the Kickstart i/o functionality requires that C++ strings are UTF-8 encoded, which they’re not by default with the 2019 version of Microsoft’s Visual C++ compiler. Recommended compiler options:

| Compiler: | Options: |
|-|-|
| g++ &amp;<br>clang | `-std=c++17` `-pedantic-errors` `-Wall` |
| Visual C++ | `/nologo` `/utf-8` `/EHsc` `/GR` `/permissive-` `/FI"iso646.h"` `/std:c++17` `/Zc:__cplusplus` `/W4` `/wd4459` `/D` `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` `/D` `_STL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` |

Happily, for Visual C++ options can be specified in environment variable `CL`, which is used automatically.


## 2. Simple text i/o.

Per early 2021 Windows implementations of the C++ language still don’t support console i/o of non-English letters. That’s sort of insane, but it’s just a sad fact. Happily Kickstart and some other libraries provide this.

Pretend that you’re a Norwegian student named Bjørn Håvard Sæther. You want to write a portable C++ program that displays your name, whether you compile and run it in Linux or in Windows. That’s easy with Kickstart:



The classic late 1978 book “*The C Programming Language*” by Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie, introduced the now just as classic program “Hello, world!”.

By compiling and successfully running “Hello, world!” one has a working example of tool usage and textual output, that one can use to further explore things.

With Kickstart a main feature is input and output of
